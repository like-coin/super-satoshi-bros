# Super Satoshi Bros

[Super Satoshi Bros](http://qualiabyte.github.io/super-satoshi-bros/) is a version of the classic NES game which replaces all of the original coins with new coins representing transaction outputs of the Bitcoin blockchain.

A minor fork of the [FullScreenMario](https://github.com/Diogenesthecynic/FullScreenMario-JSON) project which implements Super Mario Bros using JavaScript and HTML5.
